Q1: How do I download the files?

A: If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), [use this link](https://github.com/rajeevshivah/zero-to-hero-javascript/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) instead.
